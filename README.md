- ğŸ‘‹ Hey there, I am @saroj14-png!
ğŸ‘€ I am keenly interested in various areas, such as web design, production, home improvement, technology, art (explicitly sketching and teaching my children how to draw), Netflix, and cooking!
- ğŸ’» By profession, I am an IT engineer who is knowledgeable of programming language, but I have worked in design for the past few years
- ğŸŒ± Currently, I am immersing myself in coding again, explicitly focusing on JavaScript. I am already skilled in HTML5 and CSS. My ultimate aim is to become a front-end developer.
- ğŸ“« You can contact me through my social media channels, which should be available somewhere around here!
- ğŸ˜„ My preferred pronouns are she/her.
