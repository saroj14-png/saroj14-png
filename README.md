- 👋 Hey there, I am @saroj14-png!
- 👀 I am keenly interested in various areas such as web design, production, home improvement, technology, art (specifically sketching and teaching my children how to draw), Netflix, and cooking!
- 💻 By profession, I am an IT engineer who is knowledgeable of programming language, but I have worked in design for the past few years
- 🌱 Currently, I am immersing myself in coding again, specifically focusing on JavaScript. I am already skilled in HTML5 and CSS. My ultimate aim is to become a front-end developer.
- 📫 You can contact me through my social media channels, which should be available somewhere around here!
- 😄 My preferred pronouns are she/her.
- ⚡ An interesting tidbit: I have always dreamt of working with computers, and now I live that dream!
